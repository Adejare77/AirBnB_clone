# AirBnB clone - Web static

Sequel to the server side [AirBnB project Console](https://github.com/Adejare77/AirBnB_clone), In this project under the tutelage of Alx Software Engineering, we'll be building the client side front end step-by-step

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

    Create simple HTML static pages
    Style guide
    Fake contents
    No Javascript
    No data loaded from anything

During this project, we learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of our page, it is the first thing we wrote. CSS is the styling of our page, the design.
